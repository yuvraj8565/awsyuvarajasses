## Improvements and suggestions:

# 1. This APP looks like a perfect candidate for containerization as it can help with the deployments at much faster rate and can be used for serverless deployments.
# 2. If we had not used the CI- CD it could have slowed down the deployments and a better option would be to use the config managament tool for this use case.
